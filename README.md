### Hi there 👋 

I'm an avid programmer interested in data science, math, and biology.

### Data science 🧪

I'm fascinated by artificial intelligence.

- [movie-recommender-2](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/movie-recommender-2) is a collaborative-filtering-based movie recommender I designed using `scikit-surprise`.

- [enzo](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/enzo) is a neural network library I made from scratch in Python (no tensorflow, pytorch, etc.). *In progress*.

  - [perceptron](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/perceptron) is a mini-project in which I created a perceptron from scratch in C++.

### Python packages 🐍

I've published several packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/tbreydo/). Some of my favorites are:

- [pynetworks](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pynetworks), to provide structure for networks of interconnected nodes in Python.

- [movieposters](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/movieposters), to get the link to a movie's poster given its title.

<!-- - [pymastermind](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pymastermind), to make it easy to emulate the MasterMind game in Python. -->
