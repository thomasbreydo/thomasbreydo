### Hi there üëã 

I'm an avid programmer interested in math, data science, and technology.

### Data science üß™

I'm fascinated by artificial intelligence.

- [enzo](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/enzo) is a neural network library I made from scratch in Python (no tensorflow, pytorch, etc.). *In progress*.

  - [perceptron-rs](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/perceptron-rs) is a perceptron library in Rust with bindings to Python (so Python code can benefit from Rust's speed).

  - [perceptron-cpp](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/perceptron-cpp) is a mini-project in which I created a perceptron from scratch in C++.
  
- [movie-recommender-2](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/movie-recommender-2) is a collaborative-filtering-based movie recommender I designed using `scikit-surprise`.

### Python packages üêç

I've published several packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/tbreydo/). Some of my favorites are:

- [pynetworks](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pynetworks), to provide structure for networks of interconnected nodes in Python.

- [pcfg](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pcfg), to generate sentences from a probabilistic context-free grammar ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_context-free_grammar)).

<!-- - [movieposters](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/movieposters), to get the link to a movie's poster given its title. -->

<!-- - [pymastermind](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pymastermind), to make it easy to emulate the MasterMind game in Python. -->
