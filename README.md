### Hi there 👋 

I'm an avid programmer interested in data science, math, and biology.

### Data science 🧪

I'm fascinated by artificial intelligence.

- [movie-recommender-2](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/movie-recommender-2) is a collaborative-filtering-based movie recommender I designed using `scikit-surprise`.

- <a href="https://github.com/thomasbreydo/enzo" target="_blank">enzo</a> is a neural network library I made from scratch in Python (no tensorflow, pytorch, etc.). *In progress*.

  - <a href="https://github.com/thomasbreydo/perceptron" target="_blank">perceptron</a> is a mini-project in which I created a perceptron from scratch in C++.

### Python packages 🐍

I've published several packages on <a href="https://pypi.org/user/tbreydo/" target="_blank">PyPI</a>. Some of my favorites are:

- <a href="https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pynetworks" target="_blank">pynetworks</a>, to provide structure for networks of interconnected nodes in Python.

- <a href="https://github.com/thomasbreydo/movieposters" target="_blank">movieposters</a>, to get the link to a movie's poster given its title.

<!-- - <a href="https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pymastermind" target="_blank">pymastermind</a>, to make it easy to emulate the MasterMind game in Python. -->
