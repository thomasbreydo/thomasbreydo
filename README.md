## Hi there,

I'm an NYC-based developer, student, and CS enthusiast interested in math and tech. Check out [my website](https://thomasbreydo.com/).

## I implement things from scratch to learn how they work, for example:

- A perceptron in C++ (see my [repo](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/perceptron-cpp))

- A data structures library in Javaâ€”`LinkedList`, `Map`, etc. (see my [repo](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/java-data-structures))

- A binary classifier library in Rust w/ bindings to Python (see my [repo](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/perceptron-rs))

<!-- - [enzo](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/enzo): neural network library I made from scratch in Python (no tensorflow, pytorch, etc.). *In progress*. -->

## I've published several Python packages on PyPI, including:

- A package that provides structure for networks of interconnected nodes (see my [repo](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pynetworks))

- A package that generates sentences from probabilistic context-free grammars (see my [repo](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pcfg))

  - Read more about about these grammars on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_context-free_grammar)

- See the rest at [pypi.org/user/tbreydo](https://pypi.org/user/tbreydo/)

<!-- - [movieposters](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/movieposters), to get the link to a movie's poster given its title. -->

<!-- - [pymastermind](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pymastermind), to make it easy to emulate the MasterMind game in Python. -->
