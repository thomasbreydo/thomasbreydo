### Hi there 👋 

I'm an avid programmer interested in data science, math, and biology.

### Data science 🧪

I'm fascinated by artificial intelligence.

- [movie-recommender-2](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/movie-recommender-2) is a collaborative-filtering-based movie recommender I designed using `scikit-surprise`.


### Python packages 🐍

I've published several packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/tbreydo/):

- I designed [pynetworks](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pynetworks) to provide structure for networks of interconnected nodes in Python.

- I made [movieposters](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/movieposters) to get the link a movie's poster given its title.

- I created [pymastermind](https://github.com/thomasbreydo/pymastermind) to make it easy to emulate the MasterMind game in Python.
